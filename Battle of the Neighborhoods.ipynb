Finally, taking into account that the executives also would like to have a cafe or coffee shop near the office, the nighborhoods Financial District in New York City, Gerritsen Beach in New York City, Irving Park in Chicago, and Red Hook in New York City take home the trophy in the battle of the neighborhoods. Toronto simply does not compete with Chicago or New York when it comes to what the start-up executives are looking for, and 3 or the 4 winning neighborhoods are in New York City. In conclusion of this project, we recommend New York City as their destination of choice due to the wider range of neighborhood selections to suit their tastes"
